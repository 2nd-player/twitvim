Prerequisites

TwitVim uses cURL (http://curl.haxx.se/) to communicate with Twitter. Alternatively, you can configure TwitVim to use Vim's Perl, Python, Ruby, or Tcl interfaces for faster network I/O. 

Twitter OAuth requires either the OpenSSL (http://www.openssl.org/) software or a Vim binary compiled with Perl, Python, Ruby, or Tcl.

Some platforms already have cURL and OpenSSL preinstalled or have installation packages for those, so that is the easier way to satisfy the prerequisites.
